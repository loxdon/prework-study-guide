# <Your-Project-Title>

## Description

I needed a place to store what I had learnt during this bootcamp. I also needed to start practising general coding before the bootcamp starts. This project needed to be coded which was the practise and allows me to doccument my journey. I learnt that coding fundamentals (such as github) are important and can, in time become habit, allowing me to move to other more technical aspects of coding, which would have felt impossible before.
